# Walnut Loader

A lightweight testing tool for Walnut integrations.

## Usage

1. Place your integration files in the root directory:
   - `plugin.yaml` - Integration configuration
   - `driver.py` - Integration driver code
   - Any other required files

2. Run the loader:
   ```bash
   python3 loader.py
   ```

This allows you to test integrations without running the full Walnut application.
